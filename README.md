# LexiumAI

**LexiumAI** is an intelligent vision-based application designed to process real-time video from a webcam using a neural network. It determines the angle of rotation of detected objects and communicates control data to a Twido PLC via the Modbus RTU protocol.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Camera Selection

If you have multiple webcams connected, open the `config.json` file and set:

```json
"camera.cv2_index": 0
```

Change the `0` to the index of the camera you want to use (`0` to `n-1`).

### Modbus RTU Settings

To configure PLC communication, edit parameter `modbus` value(config.json)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Recommendations for Accurate Detection

Due to the neural network‚Äôs training data:

* Avoid wearing **green or red clothing**, especially **green shirts** or holding **ping-pong balls**.
* These items may be falsely detected as the target object.
* The system attempts to filter out such artifacts, but following these tips will improve detection accuracy and performance.
